        * Term first widely used by **ancient Greek thinkers** (Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle)
        * At first, *philosophy* included all areas of knowledge ‚Äî what we now call science, ethics, politics, and metaphysics

        ## Three Famous Definitions:
        
        ### üë• √âmile Durkheim (1858-1917)
        **"Religion is the social glue that binds communities together."**
        
        *Focus:* Religion creates solidarity, shared identity, and moral order in society. Think of how religious holidays bring families together, or how shared beliefs unite communities.
        
        ### üëª Edward Tylor (1832-1917)
        **"Religion is belief in spiritual beings."**
        
        *Focus:* At its core, religion involves belief in gods, spirits, souls, or supernatural forces. From ancestor worship to monotheism, spiritual beings are central.
        
        ### üíñ Paul Tillich (1886-1965)
        **"Religion is ultimate concern."**
        
        *Focus:* Religion addresses what matters most to us - our deepest values, fears, and hopes. It's about what we're willing to sacrifice everything for.
