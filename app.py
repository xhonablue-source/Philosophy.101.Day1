        ## Three Famous Definitions:
        
        ### Emile Durkheim (1858-1917)
        **"Religion is the social glue that binds communities together."**
        
        *Focus:* Religion creates solidarity, shared identity, and moral order in society. Think of how religious holidays bring families together, or how shared beliefs unite communities.
        
        ### Edward Tylor (1832-1917)
        **"Religion is belief in spiritual beings."**
        
        *Focus:* At its core, religion involves belief in gods, spirits, souls, or supernatural forces. From ancestor worship to monotheism, spiritual beings are central.
        
        ### Paul Tillich (1886-1965)
        **"Religion is ultimate concern."**
        
        *Focus:* Religion addresses what matters most to us - our deepest values, fears, and hopes. It's about what we're willing to sacrifice everything for.
        
        ## Discussion Question:
        Which definition resonates most with you? Why? Can you think of examples that fit one definition but not the others?

        "presenter_notes": "Ask students which resonates most. This is where students start to see the complexity of defining religion."

        You will have conversations with three philosophers about **argument structure concepts**:
        
        **The Five Required Question Types:**
        1. **Premise** - Basic building blocks of arguments
        2. **Contradiction** - Claims that cannot both be true
        3. **Logic** - Valid reasoning (deductive/inductive)
        4. **Fallacy** - Common errors in reasoning
        5. **Absurdity** - Reductio ad absurdum technique
        
        ### Requirements:
        - Ask **each philosopher** at least **one question** about **each concept** (5 questions per philosopher minimum)
        - Take **notes** on their responses
        - Write a **150-200 word essay** about what you learned from each philosopher
